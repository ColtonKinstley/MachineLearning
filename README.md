# MachineLearning
A location to keep notes, practice and other information while I study machine learning. I'm following [Elements of Statistical Learning][1] by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman with [Probability and Stochastics.][2] by Ã‡inlar for probability reference. Along with these [Google][4] and [Bloomberg][3] courses on machine learning.
